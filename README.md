# 🗣️ Speech-Based Search Engine

This project is a simple voice-activated search engine using Python. It captures user voice input, converts it into text using speech recognition, and then performs a web search based on the recognized text.

## 📌 Features

- Voice prompt and recognition
- Converts spoken queries into web search
- Opens search results in the default browser
- Text-to-speech feedback

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- `speech_recognition` – for voice input
- `pyttsx3` – for text-to-speech output
- `webbrowser` – to open URLs in the default browser

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speech-based-search-engine.git
cd speech-based-search-engine
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio
```

> **Note:** If you're on Windows, you might need to install [PyAudio manually](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio).

### 3. Run the Script

```bash
python "speech based search engine.py"
```

Follow the voice prompt and say your search query aloud.

## 📋 How It Works

1. The program asks the user what they want to search for.
2. The microphone records the audio input.
3. Google Speech Recognition converts the audio to text.
4. The script opens a Google search with the recognized query in the browser.
5. The program provides spoken feedback using `pyttsx3`.

## 📌 Limitations

* Requires a stable internet connection for speech recognition.
* Accuracy depends on microphone quality and ambient noise.
* Limited to Google search in this implementation.

## ✅ Future Improvements

* Add support for voice command history
* Extend to other search platforms or APIs (e.g., YouTube, Wikipedia)
* GUI interface with real-time feedback
